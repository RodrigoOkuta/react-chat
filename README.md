To start this project in dev you must to run:

npm install
npm start

To check the changes after you write a message or like someone's message you need to refresh the page. Ideally I would use redux or contextAPI to handle the global variables and it would be simpler to update the data without need to refresh the page. However, for this project I did not implemented that.

usually I keep my .env files on git ignore, but to make easier to run the project without you having to set up your own env file I added it.
